# In this example.py you will learn how to make a very simple game using the pygame library.
# One of the best ways of learning to program is by writing games.
# Pygame is a collection of modules in one package.
# You will need to install pygame.
# To do so:
# 1) open the command line interface on your computer,
# 2) cd to the directory that this task is located in,
# 3) follow the instructions here: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
# 4) if you need help using pip, see here: https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/using-pip-on-windows

import pygame # Imports a game library that lets you use specific functions in your program.
import random # Import to generate random numbers. 

# Initialize the pygame modules to get everything started.

# The screen that will be created needs a width and a height.

screen_width = 1040
screen_height = 680

# This creates the player and gives it the image found in this folder (similarly with the enemy image).

enemy = pygame.image.load("law.jpg")
enemy2 = pygame.image.load("prison.jpg")
enemy3 = pygame.image.load("cops.jpg")

# Get the width and height of the images in order to do boundary detection (i.e. make sure the image stays within screen boundaries or know when the image is off the screen).

# This checks if the up or down key is pressed.
# Right now they are not so make them equal to the boolean value (True or False) of False. 
# Boolean values are True or False values that can be used to test conditions and test states that are binary, i.e. either one way or the other.

# This is the game loop.
# In games you will need to run the game logic over and over again.
# You need to refresh/update the screen window and apply changes to 
# represent real time game play. 

while 1: # This is a looping structure that will loop the indented code until you tell it to stop(in the event where you exit the program by quitting). In Python the int 1 has the boolean value of 'true'. In fact numbers greater than 0 also do. 0 on the other hand has a boolean value of false. You can test this out with the bool(...) function to see what boolean value types have. You will learn more about while loop structers later.
